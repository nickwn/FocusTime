    <center><h1>Welcome to Focus Time!</h1></center>
      <p>If you have caught yourself spending too much time on your phone, or
         if you want to learn a new skill or spend more time studying, but have
         a hard time sitting down and concentrating on the single task, Focus Time is for you.
         Use Focus Time to improve your focus and concentration.
         Unlike other mindfulness or focus apps, Focus Time allows you to set your own
         goals and track your progress, so you can train yourself to be a more focused person.
