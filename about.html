      <p>If you have caught yourself spending too much time on your phone, or
         if you have ever found yourself constantly glancing at your phone when your
         trying to work or study, Focus Time is for you.
         Use Focus Time to improve your focus and concentration.
         Unlike other mindfulness or focus apps, Focus Time allows you to set your own
         goals and track your progress, so you can train yourself to be a more focused person.
